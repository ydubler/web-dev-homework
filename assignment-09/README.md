# Assignment 09

I am citing this website regarding the colors that emerge when we consider "Neon" which is associated with the 1980s.

The universal selector is used to style every element on a page and is signified with an asterisk, \*. For example,

\* {
font-family: Arial;
background-color: #f1f1f1;
}

will give everything Arial font and a background color. Element selectors, on the other hand, are applied to specific elements. For example,

h1 {
font-family: Arial;
background-color: #f1f1f1;
}

will apply the font and color to all h1 headings in the page. Class selectors work similarly, except that they apply to any element who class attribute matches the definition. Class selectors are signified with a leading period, . . For example,

.redbox{
background-color:red;
}

will apply the red background color to any elements whose class attribute has "redbox" in it. ID selectors are similar to class selectors, except they apply a style to a single element with a matching id. ID selectors are indicated with a leading octotroph, #. For example,

#toptext {
color:blue;
}

This will apply the blue color to a single HTML element whose id attribute is "toptext". HTML elements can not have the same id (they require a unique id) so it guarantees it will apply to only one element.

I actually chose 5 colors, one for the emission of every noble gas used in neon lights which became more popular (?) in the 1980s. They were:
Helium which is associated with #fd36f5 (pinkish red).
Neon which is associated with #fc5d57 (reddish orange).
Argon which is associated with #7b9dfc (light blue).
Xenon which is associated with #7cfde9 (bright lavendar).
And lastly, Krypton which is associated with #fffd38 (yellow white).

This works cycle I did the standard procedure: looked through the walkthrough, implemented the project requirements as stated, and referred to the website and book readings as neccesary.
