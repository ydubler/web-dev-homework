# Assignment 12

## Yuri Dubler

I definitely learned some new things about web-development. I already had intermediate knowledge about git and github using the command line so the git desktop application was a new thing -- very easy to use. In this class we mostly just committed and pushed, whereas other projects might have required us to revert to earlier commits. The biggest things I learned were the CSS selectors; I did not know that you can target an elements child elements nor did I know that you can target a different element on hover. This enabled dropdown menus. The next most important thing I learned was about the positioning properties, like margin and padding. I didn't use these properties too much in the past, but they are vital for spacing.

I definitely learned some new things about web-design. I've never been formally educated about font pairings or colors, although I've had to make these types of design choies before. Some fonts pair well together and others don't. I like to think I chose a pair of fonts that match decently well for my final website. I also learned a bit about fonts, such as what serif, sans-serif, and monospace means. I hope that I chose a set of colors that contributed to a certain theme and meshed well together.

This assignment was similar to the previous one. I only had two days to do it (Thursday and Friday) so I had to throw something together quickly and I wasn't quite sure what my website would be about. So, I just chose a theme and just put in content related to that theme. Hopefully the final will be satisfactory given the time constraints given the it has minimal content.

Thank you for teaching this class, I learned alot.
