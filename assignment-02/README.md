# Assignment 2

## Yuri Dubler

I decided to take this class to hone my web development skills. I already know how to make websites using HTML, CSS, and React but I learned these things without taking an official course on the material. Hopefully this course can smooth some of the knowledge I have acquired.

- I've learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- I hope to learn more general information about web development
- I hope to learn things that I don't expect but find useful
