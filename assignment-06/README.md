# Assignment 06

## Yuri Dubler

I've come across numerous forms on the web. They serve the purpose of gathering information which is submitted to a server for processing. The information is sent in the body of an HTTP request. Forms can be used to login to websites, to create a username/password pair for an account, and really any other purpose that is founded on gathering information.

Text inputs are used widely across the web. Logging into websites uses a text input to capture the username, and a special password text input is used to capture passwords. Text inputs are used whenever text must be gathered, and there are widespread reasons why text should be gathered. Selection inputs are used whenever someone must choose an option from a list. Selection inputs allow developers to control the options a user has and it ensures all inputs values can be consistent to a standard which might not otherwise apply. Buttons fire action scripts. Submit buttons will cause the form information to be sent to a server in an HTTP request.

This cycle, I watched the walkthrough first to get a general idea of what was expected. Then I looked at the assignment requirements and implemented them, copying the walkthrough pretty closely.
