# Assignment 12

## Yuri Dubler

My imaginary client was a friend who wants a website where he can describe his favorite hobby: 3d printing. He said he wanted to be able to describe some basic details about 3d printing and add more to the website later as it progressed. He wanted me to send him this initial version after which I would get some feedback to revise his website.

Elements styled with display:block run vertically down the page. Block display elements always behave like there is a line-space after them, so any following blocks will go to the next line.

Elements whose display is inline-block will follow each-other on the same line. However, these elements will obey spacing properties, like width, padding, and margins. These elements will alow go the next line if there isn't enough room on the current line. You must set the width of these elements to make them behave properly.

Elements whose display is inline all occur on the same line. These elements ignore width-spacing properties (width and margin) and instead take up only as much space as needed. You can not change the vertical space between these elements and other elements. They also do not force new lines.

This assignment was similar to the previous because it required a bit of time tinkering with display and position properties, in addition to lots of margins and paddings. I enjoyed using borders and I appreciate the new knowledge on how to create drop down menus. The color scheme seems reasonable to me but I'm no expert, and the fonts all seem to work well.
