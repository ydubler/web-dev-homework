# Assignment 05

## Yuri Dubler

There can only be one head and body element per page. The head element gives the browser neccessary information regarding the document's title, scripts and links to scripts, and CSS files. There are only a few tags allowed in the head tag (about 7) which limit its scope, but not its importance. The body tag, on the other hand, includes all of the information the website actually renders. The body includes everything the client sees.

Semantic markup is used to "reinforce the semantics of the information in a document". For example, bolding text is semantic because we want to place emphasis on a word. Any tags that modify the presentation of something is semantic. Structural markup "embeds information about the structure of a document". Structural markup might also help the browser interpret the content inside structural tags. Headings, paragraphs, breaks and lists are examples of structural markup.

I'm not sure what a work cycle is, but, when accomplishing these homeworks I look at the video walkthrough to see what to expect and to hear the pretty lady's voice. Then I look at the assignment's specifics and do them in order. I double check to make sure I've done everything then submit. I am using Visual Studio Code and Github Desktop.
