4. Why is using a VCS beneficial?
Version Control Systems create a new "save" of the project every time a commit is made. Version Control systems are useful because you can revert back to a previous commit if a change causes the project to break. If a team is working on a project, a VCS helps facilitate merging changes to the project, which can be messy if (for example) numerous team members are working on the same file independently. There are other beneficial features that a VCS possess, but those are the main ones.
