Divs are containers that can contain HTML elements on the block-level. Divs help us group elements in the DOM tree. Whatever class you apply to a div, it will be applied to all of it's children. Classes are defined to have style definitions and can be applied to divs and other HTML tags (supply a string to the class attribute). IDs can be used to identify any HTML element by supplying a string to the id attribute. Spans are the same thing as divs (containers) except that divs are a block-level element and spans are an inline element.

These items are different for many reasons: divs and span are HTML elements whereas class and id are properties of HTML elements. Divs are very similar to spans except that divs are block-level and spans are inline. And, classes are related to applying styles whereas id is simply an identifier for elements.

Alt text is associated with an image's alt property. Alt text is intended to help people with accessibility. Screen readers read alt text (a description of the image) out to their users so they know what the image is or means. Alt text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason: for example, network errors, content blocking, or linkrot.

The work cycle for this project is similar to all previous homeworks. First, I watch the walkthrough which helps identify the major things we are expected to do. Then, I read the actual homework objectives and implement them one by one. I go through the official website and read the content presented there. At times, I use online resources to help answer questions.
