## Yuri Dubler

My experience learning HTML has been good. I've already seen all of these elements, but, I didn't know about an image's alt attribute nor title. I knew about but never used lists or tables, so that is a new experience for me. So far, I would describe these projects as easy in difficulty but time consuming -- which is OK!

I've already used CSS before, but, I'm excited to learn CSS on a more official level. It's likely I'll learn some new things about CSS in the next module despite my previous experience with it.

For this project, I did the usual things: review the walkthrough, check out the actual directions, and refer to the text as neccesary. This time, however, I had to choose an instructable. I chose a simple recipe because all of the other things I could have presented would have been more complicated.
