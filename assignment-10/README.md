SYSTEM FONTS are fonts that are already installed on your system. These fonts are available to most programs you use on your computer, but, might not be available for use on the web (for licensing reasons). WEB FONTS, on the other hand, are custom fonts hosted on a web server (such as fonts.google.com) which make them available to everyone who links them in their HTML documents. Web fonts are downloaded when you visit a page that references them. WEB-SAFE FONTS are fonts that are guaranteed to be installed on every user's system. These fonts include ones we all know such as Arial, Georgia, Times New Roman, and numerous others. Using these fonts on a webpage can reduce load times.

The font stack is the comma delineated list of fonts in the font-family property. If the first font in the list fails to load, the browser will try to load the next font in the list, making all fonts after the first font a fallback fonts. Fallback fonts ensure that the text displayed in a website will look at least be somewhat as intended if the desired font is unavailable. This could be important for visual and programatic reasons.

There were no problems this work cycle. Followed standard procedure. I do appreciate the knowledge I've gained about fonts and the font-family property. I also appreciate that I know what serif and sans-serif means now, I've been wondering this entire time. The entire bit about typography was good -- thank you.
